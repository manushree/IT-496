<b>Google Drive

We often need a share point or share drive that allows us to share various documents with other people, and that allows those whom have the access to store, monitor, and update the documents regularly and securely. If you are looking for such solutions, Google has something very special to offer you. It’s called the Google Drive. Google Drive is yet another great offering by Google, which allows you to share, collaborate and store your data. Google Drive is a cloud-based data storage service provided by Google, which allow users to maintain their data with their responsibilities.

Google Drive offers many great features apart from storing any types and sizes of files. Google Drive allows you to synchronize your documents, and to edit and share them within a team, which supports effective and easy collaboration. It is very helpful for individual assignment as well. You can keep all your documents on Google Drive without carrying any physical devices, and will be able to access, update, and even present your files anywhere you want.

The sharing feature of Google drive makes group collaboration much easier. Any group members that have access to the folder can view and upload files to the folder and make changes to the documents. Users can have different sharing settings, which allow some files can only be viewed, and some files can be viewed and edited by other users. Group members can also collaborate on the same document at the same time. Users are no longer suffering from the exchange of a massive amount of emails and don’t need to worry about having multiple versions of a same document. For programming courses, you can connect your tools with Google drive and share different types of codes and programs. Google Drive saves you ample amount of time and increases your overall productivity.

<b>Dropbox

Dropbox is a cloud-based service for data storage, access and management. The Business Model of Dropbox is to offer a free account with fixed storage size and premium account with more capacity. Initial users will have a 2GB free account and can earn up to 16GB additional space by inviting friends to join Dropbox. Users can upgrade to Pro account by paying 9.99 dollars per month or 99 dollars per year, and will receive a 1TB space. Dropbox also ensures the security and protection of the files with the AES-256 bit encryption and two-step verification.

Dropbox can be installed on a computer and will create a special folder. Anything that the users add (or drop) to this special folder will automatically be saved in their Dropbox accounts. Users can access their files anywhere with different mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets. If users are working on individual assignment or project, they can collect and store references in their Dropbox accounts and have easy access to these files anywhere and anytime they want. In terms of a group project and assignment purpose, users can invite teammates by sharing any folder in their Dropbox accounts. One limitation of Dropbox is that users cannot collaborate at the same time.

Dropbox launched a new add-on called Mailbox in 2013, which allows users to organize their email messages. In addition to archive and delete messages, users can “snooze” messages for later use, which allows users to focus on current issues and not be overwhelmed by massive amount of emails. Users can also email files directly to their Dropbox accounts through the SendToDropbox service. For either project or course purpose, users can send documents to their Dropbox accounts and prioritize their messages based on the importance of the documents.

With Dropbox, users can access course files and notes anywhere with any mobile devices, and share these documents with others as well. Dropbox, unlike GitHub, doesn’t provide any special features for programming files. Code files can be stored and shared like other kinds of files through Dropbox.

<b>GitHub

GitHub was founded by three friends in 2008, and its headquarters is located in California, United States. There are currently 241 employees at the company. The software is coded in Ruby. GitHub was created for coding purpose, and to share code within the group. According to Wikipedia, there are around 3.4 million GitHub users as of 2014. It’s an open-source software with repositories and free account registration. It is utilized mostly by instructors, journalists, understudies and numerous different experts.

GitHub is easy to understand. There are several principal steps. The first and the most important step is to “set up a Git”, which means to make a record that can be regulated furtively and straightforwardly. The second step, “creating a repository”, is similar to the first step. It is like a workspace, where customers can provide their codes and gatherings. The third step is “fork repositories”, which allows users to make an alternate assignment from the current undertaking. Students often need to research many documents and files while working on a project or an assignment. They might want to save the files in a specific location, which allows them to have an easy access to these files at any time and from anywhere they want through the internet.

GitHub provides several special features. It has the capacity to comprehend more than 100 programming dialects. Users can implement different access control settings to their group members. An administrator level access, which permits clients to separate the parts. GitHub is extremely helpful for individual project or assignment. It empowers the users to select the level of protection, and provide incredible peculiarities.

GitHub is primarily be used for programming activities, which developers can construct new codes, and debug and utilize numerous GIT shell capacities and programs. Likewise, for non-programming courses, users can share their archives, such as exercises and records, with the others.

<b>Bitbucket

Bitbucket launched in 2008 as an independent startup but then it was acquired by Atlassian on September 29, 2010. Bitbucket is a revision control repository hosting service for the projects available in the repository of Git or Mercurial. Bitbucket used to support only Mercurial repositories but since 2011, it has also been supporting Git repositories.
Bitbucket also provide features like Wiki and Issue Tracking while creating a repository. Wiki is used for general documentation purpose where details about the repository can be saved while Issue Tracking is used for project management tasks like bug reporting and feature updates.

Anyone can use Bitbucket for individual projects or assignments as data stored in a repository can be accessed by the author from anywhere using any device. Bitbucket keep track of updates to files stored in the directory, if the new changes are not desirable then one can always roll back to the previous version of the project. We can add up to 5 users who can use a private repository and unlimited number of users if we are using a public repository. Different members of a team can work on the same project at same time. Issue tracking feature could be of great help in group assignment as everyone can review each other work and can ask to make changes by highlighting the specific area. Atlassian provides many extensions like JIRA, which can be integrated to Bitbucket making issue tracking and resolution very easy.

Programming courses should use Bitbucket as it is a sophisticated professional tool for developing software and web applications. Group members can work as a team and professor can supervise the project. Bitbucket allows multiple programmers to code simultaneously and also keep a log of every update. After a bug is reported, developer can propose a fix that has to be approved by a supervisor. Professor can see the changes made and can provide a better solution as a project supervisor.

For non-programming courses that are not much related to application development, Bitbucket can be used to do group projects or assignments where all members can work simultaneously and review each other’s work. Bitbucket is much more suitable for programming purposes, and non-programming courses will not be able to utilize most of its features.
